# Asset Setup

For the best experience, please download real images for the Banitsa and the Filling and place them in the `public/` folder.

1. **Banitsa Top**: Save an image of a round banitsa as `public/banitsa.jpg`.
   - Recommended: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Banitsa_2.jpg (You may need to convert or rename it)

2. **Filling**: Save an image of pastry layers/baklava/lasagna side as `public/filling.jpg`.
   - Recommended: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Baklava_-_layered_pastry.jpg/800px-Baklava_-_layered_pastry.jpg

If these files are missing, the app will use high-quality procedural textures instead.
